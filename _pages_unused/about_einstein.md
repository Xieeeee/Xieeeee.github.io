My name is Yang Xie (谢旸). I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in [Ren lab](https://renlab.sdsc.edu/renlab_website/) at UC San Diego. My primary research interests include gene regulation, chromatin organization, and epigenomics.

During my graduate studies, I focused on developing high-throughput, multi-modal single-cell sequencing methods to capture the epigenomic diversity in mammalian brains, aiming to link epigenome with transcription to better understand how non-coding sequences control gene expression. Check out the [project](https://xieeeee.github.io/projects/) section to know more about my work. 

I grew up in Shantou, a charming coastal city known for its delicious food. I completed my BSc in Biological Sciences from Fudan University, Shanghai. Before joing Ren lab, I worked in [O'Shea lab](https://www.salk.edu/scientist/clodagh-oshea/) at Salk Institute, where I studied how DNA folds using electron microscope and live-cell imaging.

Besides research, I enjoy listening to music, exploring different cuisines and cooking. The best part of my weekend is (currently) composed of: Fuji Kaze, Yakiniku, and Hazy IPA.
