My name is Yang Xie (谢旸). My research lies at the intersection of gene regulation, chromatin biology, and epigenomics, with a focus on understanding how the epigenome encodes cellular identity and disease risk.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the New York Genome Center, where I leverage machine learning approaches to model cell-state dynamics in development and metabolic disorders. During my Ph.D. training with Dr. Bing Ren at the University of California San Diego, I developed high-throughput, multi-modal single-cell sequencing technologies to map epigenomic diversity in mammalian brains. My goal is to connect chromatin states with genetic variation, transcriptional output, and cellular phenotype, ultimately understanding how complex non-coding perturbations propagate to cause disease.

I grew up in Shantou, a coastal city in southern China famous for its vibrant food culture. I received my B.Sc. in Biological Sciences from Fudan University in Shanghai. Before joining the Ren Lab, I trained with Dr. Clodagh O’Shea at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where I investigated chromosome folding using electron microscopy and live-cell imaging, an experience that sparked my fascination with 3D genome architecture.

Outside the lab, I enjoy music, coffee, mixology and small culinary experiments. My current favorites (respectively): Fuji Kaze, Steady State Roasting (Carlsbad), Dante (SoHo) and Yakiniku.
