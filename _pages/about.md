Hi there! My name is Yang Xie (谢旸). I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in [Ren lab](https://renlab.sdsc.edu/renlab_website/) at UC San Diego.

Our body is a complex system. Each cell in our body can have different roles and developmental trajetories, even though they usually have the same genes. The diversity is mainly driven by the way genes are turned on and off in specific places and times. This precious regulation process is controlled by different elements in our genome, through various chemical modifications and conformation changes in DNA or associated proteins, all of which make up what we call the epigenome.  

During my graduate studies, I focused on developing high-throughput, multi-modal single-cell sequencing techniques to investigate epigenomic diversity in mammalian brains, and study how does the dysregulation contribute to diseases including glioblastoma, a type of malignant brain tumor. 

I completed my BSc in Biological Sciences from Fudan University, China, with Guodong Ren as my undergraduate thesis advisor. Before joing Ren lab, I worked in [O'Shea lab](https://www.salk.edu/scientist/clodagh-oshea/) at Salk Institute, where I studied how DNA folds using electron microscope and live-cell imaging. 

Besides research, I enjoy listening to music, exploring different food and cooking. The best part of my weekend is (currently) composed of: Asian pop, contemporary French cuisine, yakiniku, gin, and Hazy IPA.   

<Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.>
